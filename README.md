          Cards are dealt from an infinite deck of cards numbered 1 to 10. 
          Dealer must hit if total is less than 17, must stand if greater 
          than or equal to 17, and busts if total is greater than 21.

Since I recovered from my mold illness last year I've done a ton of challenges on HackerRank and LeetCode.  Please contact me if you're interested in looking at my accounts there and I'll send you the credentials.
