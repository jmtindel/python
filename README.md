# python
Sample Python code.

sublist.py - Looks for a subset of a list of integers that sum
          to a given target.
          
dealer.py - Find probability dealer will go bust in simplified balckjack
          Cards are dealt from an infinite deck of cards numbered 1 to 10. 
          Dealer must hit if total is less than 17, must stand if greater 
          than or equal to 17, and busts if total is greater than 21.
          
          Building a tree would be a little crazy, but traversing one is much more efficient. ;)
